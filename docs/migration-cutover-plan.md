# Drizzle ORM Migration Cutover Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step procedure for migrating from raw SQL to Drizzle ORM in production.

## Pre-Cutover Checklist

### Code Readiness
- [x] All Drizzle repositories implemented
- [x] Feature flag system operational
- [x] Performance validation complete
- [x] Bundle size within limits
- [x] All tests passing

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards prepared
- [ ] Alert thresholds configured
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested
- [ ] Team training completed
- [ ] Support documentation ready

## Cutover Timeline

### Day 1-3: Development Environment
**Risk Level**: Minimal

1. Enable Drizzle in development
   ```bash
   export USE_DRIZZLE=true
   ```

2. Monitor for 72 hours:
   - Error rates
   - Performance metrics
   - Memory usage
   - Developer feedback

3. Decision point: Proceed or investigate issues

### Day 4-7: Staging Environment
**Risk Level**: Low

1. Deploy to staging with Drizzle enabled
   ```bash
   # staging.env
   USE_DRIZZLE=true
   ```

2. Run automated test suites
3. Perform load testing
4. Monitor for 72 hours

5. Decision point: Proceed to production or rollback

### Day 8-10: Production Canary (10%)
**Risk Level**: Medium

1. Enable Drizzle on 10% of production instances
   ```bash
   # On selected instances
   export USE_DRIZZLE=true
   ```

2. Monitor closely:
   - Response times
   - Error rates
   - Database connections
   - Memory usage

3. Hold for 48 hours
4. Decision point: Expand, hold, or rollback

### Day 11-12: Production Expansion (50%)
**Risk Level**: Medium

1. Expand to 50% of production instances
2. Continue monitoring all metrics
3. Compare performance between implementations
4. Hold for 24 hours
5. Decision point: Complete rollout or rollback

### Day 13: Full Production (100%)
**Risk Level**: Low

1. Enable Drizzle on all instances
2. Monitor for 24 hours
3. Remove feature flag code in next release

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (Any Stage)
```bash
# Method 1: Environment variable
unset USE_DRIZZLE
# or
export USE_DRIZZLE=false

# Method 2: Restart with flag disabled
pm2 restart app --update-env
```

**Time to rollback**: < 1 minute

### Data Considerations
- No data migration required
- Same database schema for both implementations
- No data transformation needed

## Monitoring Requirements

### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Baseline | Alert Threshold | Action |
|--------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Response Time (p95) | 50ms | >75ms | Investigate |
| Error Rate | 0.1% | >0.5% | Rollback |
| Memory Usage | 100MB | >150MB | Investigate |
| DB Connections | 20 | >50 | Investigate |
| CPU Usage | 30% | >60% | Investigate |

- Error Tracking: `[sentry-link]`
- APM: `[datadog-link]`

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholders
- Engineering Team
- DevOps Team
- Product Team
- Customer Support

### Communication Timeline
- **T-7 days**: Initial notification
- **T-1 day**: Final reminder
- **T+0**: Cutover begins
- **T+1 hour**: Status update
- **T+24 hours**: Success confirmation

### Escalation Path
1. On-call engineer
2. Team lead
3. Engineering manager
4. CTO

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Performance degradation | Low | High | Feature flag rollback |
| Memory leak | Very Low | High | Monitoring + rollback |
| Connection pool issues | Low | Medium | Configuration tuning |
| Type errors | Very Low | Low | Testing + TypeScript |

### Contingency Plans

#### Scenario 1: Performance Degradation
1. Check metrics dashboard
2. Compare with baseline
3. If >10% degradation, rollback
4. Investigate root cause
5. Fix and retry

#### Scenario 2: Memory Leak
1. Monitor memory trends
2. If growing >10MB/hour, rollback
3. Analyze heap dumps
4. Fix leak
5. Retry with fix

#### Scenario 3: High Error Rate
1. Check error tracking
2. If new error types, rollback
3. Fix issues
4. Add tests
5. Retry

## Success Criteria

### Go/No-Go Decision Points

#### Development Environment
- [ ] Zero new error types
- [ ] Performance within 5% of baseline
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Positive developer feedback

#### Staging Environment
- [ ] All automated tests passing
- [ ] Load test performance acceptable
- [ ] No stability issues
- [ ] Monitoring working correctly

#### Production Canary
- [ ] Error rate <0.5%
- [ ] Response time <10% increase
- [ ] Memory stable
- [ ] No customer complaints

#### Full Production
- [ ] All metrics within acceptable range
- [ ] No rollback triggered
- [ ] System stable for 24 hours

## Post-Cutover Tasks

### Week 1
