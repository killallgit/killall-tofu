export USE_DRIZZLE=true
npm run dev
```

### Phase 2: Staging Rollout
```bash
# 10% of instances with Drizzle
export USE_DRIZZLE=true  # On selected instances
```

### Phase 3: Production Rollout
```bash
# Gradual increase from 10% → 50% → 100%
# Monitor metrics at each stage
```

### Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Instant rollback if issues detected
unset USE_DRIZZLE
# or
export USE_DRIZZLE=false
```

## Risk Assessment
